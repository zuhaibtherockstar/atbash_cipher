OVERVIEW
--------------------------------------------------
The Atbash Cipher is one of the oldest known substitution ciphers.
It works by reversing the alphabet, so:

A ‚Üî Z
B ‚Üî Y
C ‚Üî X
...
Z ‚Üî A

For example:
HELLO becomes SVOOL

It is a simple yet elegant cipher that demonstrates
the core idea of cryptography ‚Äî transforming readable
text into a hidden form.

--------------------------------------------------
FEATURES
--------------------------------------------------
- Encrypts and decrypts text symmetrically
- Works with both uppercase and lowercase letters
- Preserves spaces, numbers, punctuation, and emojis
- Written in clean and readable Python code
- Ideal for understanding substitution ciphers

--------------------------------------------------
EXAMPLE RUN
--------------------------------------------------
üîê Welcome to the Atbash Cipher Program üîê
Enter your text: Hello, World!

Encrypted Text: Svool, Dliow!
Decrypted Text: Hello, World!

--------------------------------------------------
HOW IT WORKS
--------------------------------------------------
1. Each letter is mirrored across the alphabet.
   Example: A (1st) ‚Üî Z (26th), B (2nd) ‚Üî Y (25th)
2. The program checks if each character is:
   - Uppercase: Converts using ASCII range 65‚Äì90
   - Lowercase: Converts using ASCII range 97‚Äì122
3. Non-alphabetic characters are left unchanged.

--------------------------------------------------
CODE SUMMARY
--------------------------------------------------
Function: atbash_cipher(text)
- Takes a string as input
- Loops through each character
- Replaces alphabetic characters with their reverse
- Returns the encrypted (or decrypted) string

Since Atbash is symmetric, the same function
works for both encryption and decryption.

--------------------------------------------------
USAGE
--------------------------------------------------
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/atbash_cipher.git

2. Run the script:
   python atbash_cipher.py

3. Enter your text when prompted.
   The program will display the encrypted
   and decrypted results.

--------------------------------------------------
REAL-WORLD CONNECTION
--------------------------------------------------
Although the Atbash Cipher is not secure by
modern standards, it introduces the basic concept
of substitution used in more advanced ciphers like
Caesar and Vigen√®re.

It‚Äôs a great way to see how ancient logic inspired
modern cryptographic algorithms.

--------------------------------------------------
REFLECTION
--------------------------------------------------
The Atbash Cipher‚Äôs simplicity is what makes it
so fascinating. With just a few lines of Python,
we can bring an ancient encryption method to life.

It reminds us that even simple patterns and logic
can lead to deep insights ‚Äî both in programming
and in understanding human creativity.
